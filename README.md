# Investigating Tumour Responses to Radiotherapy and Hyperthermia

This repository contains the MATLAB code used to numerically solve the ODE model of tumour responses to radiotherapy and hyperthermia proposed in [1] and to determine the best treatment and dosing regimen among those considered in [1]. All details for how to run the codes, can be found in the MATLAB scripts. For reproducibility purposes, we also include spreadsheets that contain the parameter sets that define the three virtual cohorts, and spreadsheets that contain the output of numerical simulations used to create the figures in [1].
